# Human Readable Ordered List (aka Index) Guidelines
Rules follow the *(Y + rule number)* format to make each rule easily referencable.

| Index Range | Topic |
| ----------- | ----- |
| 1000 - 1999 | Windows rules only applicable to Microsoft Windows. |

Refer to the [yara index](yara_index.md) for desriptions of each yara rule.

Each index is further broken down into specific sub-groups.
(i.e., Y1174 would be a pack focused on process visibility only for Windows.)
