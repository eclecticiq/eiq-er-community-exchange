# Human Readable Ordered List (aka Index) Guidelines
Rules follow the *(Y + rule number)* format to make each rule easily referencable.

| Index Range | Topic |
| ----------- | ----- |
| 1-999 | Universal rules applicable to more than one operating system. |

Refer to the [yara index](yara_index.md) for desriptions of each yara rule.

Each index is further broken down into specific sub-groups.
(i.e., Y174 would be a pack focused on process visibility for all platforms.)

| Index Grouping | Topic Group Description |
