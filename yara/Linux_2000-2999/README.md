# Human Readable Ordered List (aka Index) Guidelines
Rules follow the *(Y + rule number)* format to make each rule easily referencable.

| Index Range | Topic |
| ----------- | ----- |
| 2000 - 2999 | Linux rules generally applicable to any Linux distribution. |

Refer to the [yara index](yara_index.md) for desriptions of each yara rule.

Each index is further broken down into specific sub-groups.
(i.e., P2174 would be a pack focused on process visibility only for Linux.)
