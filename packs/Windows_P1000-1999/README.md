# Human Readable Ordered List (aka Index) Guidelines
Pack numbering follows the *(P + rule number)* format to make each pack easily referencable.

| Index Range | Topic |
| ----------- | ----- |
| 1000 - 1999 | Windows packs only applicable to Microsoft Windows. |

Refer to the [pack index](pack_index.md) for desriptions of each query pack.

Each index is further broken down into specific sub-groups.
(i.e., P174 would be list packs focused on process visibility only for Windows.)
