# Contributor Code of Conduct
Welcome to the EclecticIQ Community. Our goal is to foster an open, safe, and welcoming environment. As a collective, we as contributors, maintainers, and leaders within EclecticIQ, pledge to encourage participation and create this community to be a harassment-free space. We invite you to collaborate, exchange thoughts or information, and engage with one another. EclecticIQ Community content is for everyone, regardless of age, personal appearance, body size, disability, nationality, race, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience or academics, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Enforcement & Consequences
Report any instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior to the Community Manager. Community members, maintainers, and EclecticIQ team members will not tolerate unacceptable behavior. The EclecticIQ Community Manager and maintainers will review and investigate all complaints. 
Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior should comply immediately. If an EclecticIQ community member (anyone contributing to our [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/eclecticiq/endpoint-query-packs) or [Community Slack](https://osquery.slack.com/archives/C9U2DM98C)) engages in unacceptable behavior, the Community Manager may take any temporary or permanent action they deem appropriate, up to and including immediate expulsion from the EclecticIQ community without warning.

EclecticIQ Community maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project’s leadership.

## Manager’s & Maintainers’ Responsibilities

This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces, including public spaces where an individual is representing the EclecticIQ community. Examples of representing the project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.
