# EclecticIQ Community

The goal of this project is to provide community inspired use cases leveraging the visibility of the EclecticIQ endpoint solution. The EclecticIQ endpoint osquery-based agent and EclecticIQ osquery extension provides unrivaled visibility into file, process, users, registry, and network events for all server, workstation, laptop, and container endpoints.

While the content is aligned to the EclecticIQ platform, many of the queries may also function on generic osquery deployments. Given there is no single repository collecting such queries, EclecticIQ is providing open access to all queries in support of the osquery community. 


## Get started

You will need an EclecticIQ endpoint platform installed. You can either download the [free version here](https://github.com/eclecticiq/eiq-er-ce) or [speak with EclecticIQ](mailto:sales@eclecticiq.com) about a commercially available version that includes additional features and functionality.

*All content should be tested in a lab environment before executing against anything in production.*
