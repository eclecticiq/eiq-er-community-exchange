# Human Readable Ordered List (aka Index) Guidelines
Event Filter numbering follows the *(F + rule number)* format to make each Event Filter easily referencable.

| Index Range | Topic |
| ----------- | ----- |
| 2000 - 2999 | Linux filters generally applicable to any Linux distribution. |

Refer to the [event filter index](filter_index.md) for desriptions of each Event Filter.

Each index is further broken down into specific sub-groups.
(i.e., F2174 would be an event filter focused on process filtering only for Linux.)
