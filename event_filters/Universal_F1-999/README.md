# Human Readable Ordered List (aka Index) Guidelines
Event Filter numbering follows the *(F + rule number)* format to make each Event Filter easily referencable.

| Index Range | Topic |
| ----------- | ----- |
| 1-999 | Universal filters applicable to more than one operating system. |


Refer to the [event filter index](filter_index.md) for desriptions of each Event Filter

Each index is further broken down into specific sub-groups.
(i.e., F174 would be an event filter focused on process filtering for all platforms.)

| Index Grouping | Topic Group Description |
| -------------- | ----------------------- |
| F1 - F99 | System information |
| F100 - F199 | Process |
| F200 - F299 | Network |
| F300 - F399 | File |
| F400 - F499 | User |
| F500 - F599 | *undefined* |
| F600 - F699 | *undefined* |
| F700 - F799 | *undefined* |
