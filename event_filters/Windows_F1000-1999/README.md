# Human Readable Ordered List (aka Index) Guidelines
Event Filter numbering follows the *(F + rule number)* format to make each Event Filter easily referencable.

| Index Range | Topic |
| ----------- | ----- |
| 1000 - 1999 | Windows filters only applicable to Microsoft Windows. |

Refer to the [event filter index](filter_index.md) for desriptions of each Event Filter

Each index is further broken down into specific sub-groups.
(i.e., F1174 would be an event filter focused on process filtering only for Windows.)
