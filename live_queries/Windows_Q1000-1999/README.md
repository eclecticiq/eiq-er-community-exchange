# Human Readable Ordered List (aka Index) Guidelines
Query numbering follows the *(Q + rule number)* format to make each Live Query easily referencable.

| Index Range | Topic |
| ----------- | ----- |
| 1000 - 1999 | Windows queries only applicable to Microsoft Windows. |

Refer to the [query index](query_index.md) for desriptions of each Live Query.

Each index is further broken down into specific sub-groups.
(i.e., P1174 would be live queries focused on process visibility only for Windows.)

| Index Grouping | Topic Group Description |
| -------------- | ----------------------- |
| 1 - 99 | System information |
| 100 - 199 | Process |
| 200 - 299 | Network |
| 300 - 399 | Monitoring Use cases |
| 400 - 499 | *undefined* |
| 500 - 599 | *undefined* |
| 600 - 699 | *undefined* |
| 700 - 799 | *undefined* |
